You will need to:
npm install mtwitter
npm install cartodb


once you have API keys and a CartoDB/twitter authentication filled out (I'll email this info), the CartoTweets file should log tweets related to places in the places CartoDB table.

We want to insert these into a posts table, so that we can map them. Currently uncommenting that line causes an error. I'll fix that later tonight or maybe tomorrow.
